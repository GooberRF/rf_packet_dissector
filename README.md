This is a Wireshark Lua dissector for packets associated with Red Faction 2001 (PC), as well as the Alpine Faction and Pure Faction community patches.

This dissector is NOT complete, is very much a work in progress, and I generally only update it when I need it to do something new. If you find a bug (there are plenty) and wish to fix it, please feel free to PR your changes.

Packet documentation from rafalh's `rf-reversed` project was invaluable in the creation of this utility: https://github.com/rafalh/rf-reversed
